# Forest Health and Prediction
## About This File
This file contains a dataset focused on various ecological and environmental measurements related to tree characteristics and site conditions. The dataset includes information on tree dimensions, soil composition, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, allowing for comprehensive analysis of the relationships between these variables.

Key Features:
Geographical Information: Latitude and longitude for each plot.
Tree Metrics: Diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, and crown dimensions.
Soil Composition: Measurements of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and available nutrients.
Environmental Conditions: Recorded temperature and humidity levels.
Ecological Indices: Menhinick and Gleason indices for assessing biodiversity.
Disturbance and Fire Risk: Levels of ecological disturbance and fire risk indices.
Health Status: Classification of tree health.
The dataset is intended for use in ecological research and studies related to forestry, biodiversity, and environmental health.
